----------DESCRIPTION:----------

Virtual Pet Pomeranian is a cute , animated dog on your watch that you can power up with your steps! 

Modeled after a real Pomeranian, this virtual dog has a grumpy, but cute personality. 'Mr. Crunchy', a real Pomeranian puppy from California, was used as the inspiration and model for the design. The Pomeranian is a blue merle, and has two blue eyes giving it a look of both a Husky and Aussie.  

Have fun exercising as this little dog gains hearts while you reach your goals. The virtual dog has three modes: sitting, walking, and sleeping. Based on the number of hearts you earn, the dog will change what it does and will have different moods.
